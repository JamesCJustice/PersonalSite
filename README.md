# Personal Site

This is my personal site, a continuation of the node site I removed from the ManafestLore repo.
A webserver was wasted on merely serving static files, but I'll find some nifty things to do with this one. This website exists for me to practice front-end skills, develop utilities, and try out weird ideas.

# /ideaguy/
Yup, this section is pretty much a pile of checks that I may or may not cash.
Nice-to-haves and huge scope features as well as poorly-articulated ones go here.
Now in agile story flavor.

## Hub page
As a site owner, I would like a page where users can see the status of the 
site's main features at a glimpse so that they can easily know if their action 
is required or available for goings on.

## /about page
As the site owner, I would like to display a portfolio page showcasing my
work so that I can show off my obligatory website.

## announcements
As a site owner, I would like to publicly display announcements so that
users are aware of updates and changes. 

## server list
As a host of a multiplayer Manafest game that is using the auth service, I
would like my server to show up in a list of other servers so that I can 
attract new players.

## Characters
As the developer of a meta-game site, I would like to be able to create and store both player and non-player characters so that a payer's character can persist between a given game's servers, multiple games, and on the website.

- create/edit character page
