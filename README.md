# Personal Site

This is my personal site, a continuation of the node site I removed from the ManafestLore repo.
A webserver was wasted on merely serving static files, but I'll find some nifty things to do with this one. This website exists for me to practice front-end skills, develop utilities, and try out weird ideas.
