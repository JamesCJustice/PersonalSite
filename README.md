# Personal Site

This is my personal site, a continuation of the node site I removed from the ManafestLore repo.
A webserver was wasted on merely serving static files, but I'll find some nifty things to do with this one. This website exists for me to practice front-end skills, develop utilities, and try out weird ideas.



# /ideaguy/
Yup, this section is pretty much a pile of checks that I may or may not cash.
Nice-to-haves and huge scope features as well as poorly-articulated ones go here.
Now in agile story flavor.

## /about page
As the site owner, I would like to display a portfolio page showcasing my
work so that I can show off my obligatory website.

## /profile/<username> page
As a user, I would like to see a profile page displaying public information
about other users so that I have a better idea who I'm talking to.

## /profile/account page
As a registered user, I would like to be able to edit what information is
displayed publically on my profile and change other settings.

## password reset flow
As a returning user who has forgotten his password, I would like to be able
to have a password reset link sent to my email address so that I can continue
using the site.

## chatroom
As a returning user, I would like to be able to chat with other online users
in real-time in order to coordinate multiplayer gaming sessions.

## announcements
As a site owner, I would like to publicly display announcements so that
users are aware of updates and changes. 

## server list
As a host of a multiplayer Manafest game that is using the auth service, I
would like my server to show up in a list of other servers so that I can 
attract new players.
